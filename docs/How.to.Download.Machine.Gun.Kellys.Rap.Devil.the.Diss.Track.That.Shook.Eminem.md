"Rap Devil" was a response to Eminem's song "Not Alike", which featured a verse where he criticized MGK for making a comment about his daughter Hailie in 2012. MGK did not hold back in his diss track, calling Eminem a "dweeb", a "bitch" and a "rap god" who is past his prime. He also accused him of being insecure, jealous and hiding behind his security and Dr. Dre's beats.
 
The diss track went viral and received mixed reactions from fans and critics. Some praised MGK for having the courage to challenge Eminem, while others dismissed him as a clout chaser who was no match for the legendary rapper. Eminem later responded with another diss track called "Killshot", which was even more brutal and personal than "Rap Devil".

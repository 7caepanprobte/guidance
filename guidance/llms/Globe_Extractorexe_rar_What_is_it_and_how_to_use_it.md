An executable file (.exe) is a program that can run on your computer and perform some actions. A compressed archive file (.rar) is a file that contains one or more files that have been reduced in size to save space and bandwidth. You need a special program, such as WinRAR[^1^] or 7-Zip[^7^], to open and extract the files inside a .rar archive.
 
Globe Extractor.exe .rar is a file that contains both an executable file and a compressed archive file. The executable file is called Globe Extractor.exe and the compressed archive file is called Modern Warfare 2.7Z. The purpose of Globe Extractor.exe is to extract and convert the files inside Modern Warfare 2.7Z so that you can play the game on your computer.
 
To use Globe Extractor.exe .rar, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Extract Modern Warfare 2.7Z from Globe Extractor.exe .rar using WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and choosing "Extract here" or "Extract to Modern Warfare 2".
2. Move the extracted folder to your desktop or another location of your choice.
3. Run Globe Extractor.exe by double-clicking on it. This will start the conversion and extraction process, which may take between 30 to 40 minutes depending on your computer's performance.
4. Wait until the workedfolders.rar file that appears after starting the conversion disappears. This means that the game is ready to use.
5. Start the game with iw4sp.exe by double-clicking on it.

Note: Globe Extractor.exe .rar may not be a safe or legitimate file. It may contain viruses, malware, or unwanted software that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. It may also be a pirated or illegal copy of the game or software that violates the copyright laws. Therefore, you should only download files from trusted sources and scan them with an antivirus program before opening them.

## How to Prevent and Recover from Ransomware Attacks
 
Ransomware attacks are a serious threat to any organization, as they can cause significant damage, disruption, and financial loss. Ransomware attackers can encrypt your files, steal your data, and extort you for money. Therefore, it is essential to take proactive measures to prevent and recover from ransomware attacks. Here are some tips on how to do so:

- **Never click on unverified links**. One of the most common ways that ransomware attackers infect your computer is by sending you spam emails or malicious websites that contain links that initiate a malware download. If you click on such a link, you may unknowingly install ransomware on your system. Therefore, you should always be careful about what you click on and avoid opening suspicious or unsolicited emails or visiting unknown websites[^2^].
- **Install antivirus and anti-malware software**. Another way to protect your computer from ransomware is to install antivirus and anti-malware software that can detect and remove malicious programs before they cause any harm. You should also keep these software updated with the latest signatures and patches, as ransomware attackers often exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Additionally, you should turn on automatic updates for both solutions and use a centrally managed antivirus solution if possible[^5^].
- **Back up your files**. One of the best ways to recover from a ransomware attack is to have a backup of your files that you can restore in case of an emergency. You should back up your files frequently and automatically, using a cloud service or an external hard drive. You should also make sure that your backup is not connected to your network or computer when not in use, as ransomware attackers may try to encrypt or delete your backup as well[^4^].
- **Turn on controlled folder access**. If you are using Windows 10 or 11, you can turn on controlled folder access to protect your important local folders from unauthorized programs like ransomware or other malware. Controlled folder access prevents any program from making changes to your files unless you allow it. This way, you can prevent ransomware from encrypting or deleting your files without your permission[^4^].
- **Get ransomware detection and recovery with Microsoft 365 advanced protection**. If you are using Microsoft 365 for work or school, you can benefit from its advanced protection features that can help you detect and recover from ransomware attacks. For example, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 can scan your email attachments and links for ransomware and alert you if they are malicious. Microsoft OneDrive can also detect ransomware activity on your files and notify you if it happens. Moreover, Microsoft OneDrive can help you restore your files to a previous version before the ransomware attack[^1^].

By following these tips, you can reduce the risk of falling victim to a ransomware attack and minimize the impact if it happens. However, if you do get infected by ransomware, do not pay the ransom, as there is no guarantee that the attackers will honor their promise or not ask for more money. Instead, contact your IT department or a reputable cybersecurity expert for assistance.
